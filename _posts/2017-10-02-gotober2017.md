## What to expect from software developers

This is just a proof of concept, phishing attacks are illegal! Don't use this in any of your apps. The goal of this blog post is to close the loophole that has been there for many years, and hasn't been addressed yet. For moral reasons, I decided not to include the actual source code of the popup, however it was shockingly easy to replicate the system dialog.

```java
@Component(service=StopLoopWithNormalVariable.class)
public class StopLoopWithNormalVariable extends Thread {

	boolean stop;

	@Activate
	void activate() {
		start();
	}

	public void run() {
		while (!stop)
		;
	}

	@Deactivate
	void deactivate() {
		stop = true;
	}
}
```
